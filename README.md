## File Details
- Advanced_Regression_Submission.ipynb : Jupiter notebook with Linear, Ridge and Lasso regressions
- Advanced regression Submission.pdf : Contains the answers to the quries in Part II.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Lasso regression model better fits the data, as it simplifies the equation
